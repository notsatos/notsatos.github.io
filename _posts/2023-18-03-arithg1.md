I just now got a copy of *An invitation to Arithmetic Geometry* by Dino Lorenzini, which I'm very excited to get into. Arithmetic geometry, even though I'm not trained in, is my main interest; somewhat strange as I've never gotten into the mud with the subject before until now. Actually, my main motivation (well now it's second as I learned I loved the subject independently from this) to learn algebraic geometry (the theory of schemes in particular) was to learn arithmetic geometry later down the line. Sadly, in a way, *An invitation to Arithmetic Geometry*, from what I've skimmed, doesn't employ the theory of schemes: one can see this as a benefit or a drawback. Personally, I do not mind as I think I will be able to think of arithmetic geometry in a more conrete and down-to-earth way as the machinery of scheme theory could make some concepts in arithmetic geometry blurred as it's my first formal introduction. 

I plan to use this website as notes, in a way: there are twelve sections to the book and what my plan is for now is to go through each section where in the end I'll write a corresponding post on here to summarize my understanding. Writing freely about what I have learned and solidified in my own will definitely bring to me a better understanding. Beyond these posts, my own ambition is to host a learning seminar for arithmetic geometry (possibly following this book along) in the fall of this year.
