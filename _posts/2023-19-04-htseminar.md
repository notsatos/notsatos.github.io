This is a very incomplete webpage that will be used as a webpage for a homotopy theory learning seminar to be hosted throughout the Fall of 2023. The seminar is being hosted by two students: Aaron Andrews and Juan Serratos. As of writing, the two students are undergraduates and likely the target audience are undergraduate math students with some experience with category theory and other related topics, but of course anyone is welcome.


The seminar will follow a set of notes that are being written, but nothing is set in stone as of now. Further details about the seminar will be provided leading up to the Fall semester of 2023, and this webpage will be frequently updated. A current set of notes (April 22nd, 2023, so this is a very, very rough sketch of first steps): <a href="https://notsatos.github.io/files/homotopy_seminar.pdf">here</a>.
