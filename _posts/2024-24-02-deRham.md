### 1. Review

We start with a basic recollection of differential forms. The basic setup is the following: Let $k$ be a field and $V$ a $k$-vector space. A map $f \colon V^q \to k$ is said to be *multilinear* if it is linear in each component, and we denote the collection of all these makes over $V$ by $\mathfrak T^q (V)$. This is easily checked to be a $k$-vector space, which has dimension $n^q$, where $n = \text{dim } (V)$. A special kind of map $f \in \mathfrak T^q (V)$ that we're interested are those which are *alternating* and this is to say that $f$ has the property that for every $\sigma \in S_q$ we have $f(x_{\sigma(1)}, \ldots, x_{\sigma (q)} )) = \text{sgn } \sigma f(x_1, \ldots, x_q)$. We denote the collection of all of these as $\mathfrak A^q (V)$, which is easlily checked to be a subspace of $\mathfrak T^q(V)$. For example, suppose that we're working with $q = 3$. Then for the permutation $\sigma = (1 \; 2 \; 3)$, and $f \in \mathfrak A^3 (V)$, $f(x_{\sigma(1)}, x_{\sigma(2)}, x_{\sigma(3)}) = f(x_2, x_3, x_1) =  f(x_1, x_2, x_3)$ since $\sigma = (1 \; 2 \; 3) = (2 \; 3) (1 \; 3 ) $, i.e. an even length of permutations in its decomposition. A more general and important property of alternating maps is that if we have $\sigma \in S_q$ defined by $\sigma = (i \; i+1)$ (this is an odd permutation as it's already a transposition) where $1 \leq i < q$, then $f(x_{\sigma(1)}, \ldots, x_{\sigma(i)}, x_{\sigma(i+1)}, \ldots, x_{\sigma(q)} ) =f(x_1, \ldots, x_{i+1}, x_i, \ldots, x_q) = - f(x_1, \ldots, x_i, x_{i+1}, \ldots, x_q)$.
