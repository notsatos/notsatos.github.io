### 1.  Complex Topology

It's often useful to utilize the fact that we can consider the complex plane, $\mathbb C$, as two copies of the real line, i.e. $\mathbb C \cong \mathbb R \times \mathbb R$ (as $\\{1, i \\}$ forms a basis for $\mathbb C$ over $\mathbb R$), so we should think about analysis over $\mathbb R^2$ for a little bit. So, if we have a function $f \colon \mathbb R^2 \to \mathbb R$, we say that $\lim_{(x_0, y_0) \to (x,y)} f(x_0, y_0) = L$ if, for all $\epsilon > 0$, there exists $\delta > 0$ such that $|f(x_0,y_0) - L | < \epsilon$. whenever $0 < \sqrt{(x_0-x)^2 + (y_0-y)^2 }<\delta$, and we say that $f$ is *continuous* at $(x,y)$ if $\lim_{(x_0, y_0) \to (x,y)} f(x_0, y_0) = f(x,y)$. Furthermore, the limit $ \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(a+h, b) - f(a,b) }{h} = \frac{\partial f}{ \partial x} $, if it exists, is called the partial derivative of $f$ at $x$, and $\frac{\partial f}{ \partial y} = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(a, b + h) - f(a,b) }{h} $. Now, the complex plane becomes a metric space by be expressing every element $z \in \mathbb C$ as a linear combination $z = a +ib$ and then defining $| z| = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$, which is just the Euclidean metric of $a-b$.
