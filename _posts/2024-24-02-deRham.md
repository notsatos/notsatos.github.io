Suppose we're woking with an affine variety $X$ over a base field $k = \mathbb C$, i.e. $X$ is isomorphic to a closed subscheme of $\mathbf A^n_k$ for some $n$. That is, $X = \text{Spec } (\mathbb C[x_1, \ldots, x_m])/(f_1, \ldots, f_m)$ for a collection of polynomials $f_1, \ldots, f_m \in k [x_1, \ldots, x_n]$. Then we would look at the collection of *actual solutions* to $f_1, \ldots, f_m$ and we denote the collection as $X(\mathbb C)$. As this a subset of $\mathbb C$, then we have a natural topology to endow it, i.e. the complex-plane topology (which is just essentially the Euclidean topology).
