What I've been interested in as of today is on Euler's sum of powers conjecture, which of course has been disproven to be true. Just to make sure we're on the same page, the conjecture states the following:

*Conjecture (False)*. Let $n$ and $k$ be positive integers. If 
$$ X_1^k + X_2^k + \cdots X_n^k = Y^k,$$
then $n \geq k$.

This should look somewhat familiar.
