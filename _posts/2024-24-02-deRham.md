What I've been interested in as of today is on Euler's sum of powers conjecture, which of course has been disproven to be true. Just to make sure we're on the same page, the conjecture states the following:

*Conjecture (False)*. Let $n$ and $k$ be positive integers. If 
$$ X_1^k + X_2^k + \cdots X_n^k = Y^k,$$
 then $n \geq k$.

This should look somewhat familiar, as the case of $n = 2$ is Fermat's Last Theorem, i.e. $X_1^k + Y_2^k = Z^k$ implies $2 \geq k$. Thus, for the case of $k = 3$, the conjecture holds true. However, for $k=4$ and $k=5$, the conjecture is known to be false. It was disproven with a computer search for $k=5$ (presumably, the smallest solutions); the counterexample is $144^5 = 27^5 + 84^5 + 110^5 + 133^5$. For $k =4$, Noam Elkies provided a counterexample: $20615673^{4}=2682440^{4}+15365639^{4}+18796760^{4}$, although his method was much more methodicalâ€”we will look into his method for the first section of this post. What I've been thinking about now is the case of $k = 6$, which has a lot of nice properties. But, it is unknown whether the conjecture fails or holds for any value $k \geq 6$. I do not have a personal belief whether or not a solution should exist yet, but I've broken down some cases. 


### 1. Elkies' $k=4$ counterexample.


### 2. On the case of $k=6$
Say we wanted to disprove for this case as well: we should omit possible cases. To disprove the case of $k=6$, we want to show that we have a nontrival solution to the polynomial $f = X_1^6 + X_2^6 + \cdots + X_5^6 - Y^6$  in $\mathbb Z [X_1, \ldots, X_7]$. What can be immediately worked on is to omit possible cases. Suppose we have a solution $(x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_5, y) \in \mathbb Z^{\oplus 7}$.
