I've always quite liked learned about derived functors, although I wasn't really grasping the motivation when initially learning some basic things about $\operatorname{Ext}^i (-,-) $ and $\operatorname{Tor}^i (-,-)$, which are *derived* from the left exact functor $\operatorname{Hom} (-,-)$ and $-\otimes -$, respectively. This verb *derived* actually has comes from thinking about derived categories, but to get at this perspective, it takes a lot of effort! I'm writing this document, <a href="https://notsatos.github.io/files/derived_fntrs_cats copy.pdf">Derived Functors and Derived Categories</a>, which I hope to motivate the things I've spoken about above, hopefully in a rewarding way. 

The first time I came to learning about
