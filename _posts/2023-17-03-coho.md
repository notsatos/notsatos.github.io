There is an object in mathematics that I believe, at least for someone interested in surrounding areas of algebra (but definitely in other areas as well!), that one will encounter again and again (there will never be a time without its importance): (co)homology. The study of homology theory can be motivated in many ways, e.g. (co)homology being an invariant attached to a topological spaces. That is, (co)homology are invariant under homotopy equivalence, so if two topological spaces have different (co)homology then they are not equivalent. To be clear, (co)homology assigns to any topological space $X$ a sequence of abelian groups $H_k (X)$, $ k \geq 0 $, and to any continuous map $f \colon X \to Y$ of topological spaces, a sequence of homomorphisms $f_\ast \colon H_k (X) \to H_k (Y)$, $k \geq 0$. The study of homological algebra is something that has (arguably) a lot of its strength in topology, but homological algebra in its own right has a lot to say about other algebraic structures in the field of algbera. Attached to this vein, Eisenbud's analogy is that homological algebra is to ring theory as representation theory is to group theory. A simple problem (that is really not so simple) that can be reformulated in terms of homological algebra is as follows:


Given a variety $V(f_1, \ldots, f_n)$, we may want to ask ourselves if we can define this same variety for a small amount of polynomial equations; that is, there exists polynomials $g_1, \ldots, g_m$ where $m <n$ such that $ \sqrt{(g_1,\ldots, g_m)} = \sqrt{(f_1,\ldots, f_n)}$. This problem relates to Hilbert's Nullstellensatz, which says that the only other polynomials which vanish on $V(f_1,\ldots, f_n)$ are the ones in $ \sqrt{(f_1,\ldots, f_n)}$. Recall for an ideal $I \subset k[T_1, \ldots, T_n] =A$ we define $V(I)= \\{ x \in k^n \colon f(x) = 0, \forall f \in I \\}$, and for a subset $Y \subset k^n$ we define $I(Y) = \\{ f \in A \colon f(x)=0, \forall x \in Y \\}$.


 **Theorem (Nullstellensatz).** Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field. If $I$ is an ideal of $k[T_1, \ldots, T_n]$, then $$I(V(I))=\sqrt{I}.$$


 The question we might have about the above $V(f_1,\ldots, f_n)$ is: What if there isn't such a collection $\\{g_1, \ldots, g_m\\}$? How can we know? Well, it turns out that *local cohomology* is way to prove this: Given an noetherian ring $A$ and an ideal $I \subset A$, if $I$ can be generated by $n$ elements, then for any $A$-module $M$ and any $i >n$, we must have $H^i_I(M)=0$. Hence to prove that $I$ cannot be generated by $n$ many elements, it suffices to find an $A$-module $M$ such that $H^{n+1} _I (M) \neq 0 $. 


For example, consider $V(f_1, f_2)$ where $f_1 (T)= T+1$ and $f_2 (T) = T-1$ in $\mathbf F_2 [T]$. Then we have $V(f_1, f_2) = \\{ 1 \\}$, and it is clear that we can define a function so that $V(f) = V(f_1, f_2)$, e.g. $f(T) = T^2-1$, so $V(f) = V(f_1, f_2)$ which implies $ \sqrt{(f)} = \sqrt{(f_1, f_2)} = J$. Using the above, as $\mathbf F_2[T]$ is noetherian, we have that for any $\mathbf F_2[T]$-module $M$ and $i > 1$ the equality $H^i_J(M) = 0$. We should note here that this doesn't really mean anything to the reader who hasn't met cohomology before. The definition of $H^i_J(M)$ and *local cohomology* is already quite advanced; the definition of $H^i_J (M)$ already requires the use of derived functors and an inverse limit, i.e. $H^i_J (M):= \varinjlim \limits_{n \in \mathbf  N} \mathrm {Ext }_{\mathbf F_2[T]} ^i (\mathbb F_2[T]/J^n , M)$. The concept of local cohomology was introduced by Grothendieck when he was at Harvard in $1961$.

## 1. Exact sequences


**Definition 1.1.** A sequence $L \xrightarrow{\varphi}  M \xrightarrow{\psi} N$ of $A$-modules and $A$-linear maps is called **exact** (**at $M$**) if $\mathrm{im \,}  \varphi = \mathrm{ker \, } \psi$.

There are immediately many ways to talk about exactness of special sequences, which are more-or-less obvious. Before that, a first concept we learn about in homological algebra (often not mention in a usual algebra course in undergrad.) is that, for an $A$-linear map $\varphi \colon M \to N$, we define the *cokernel* of $\varphi$ as $\mathrm {coker\,}\varphi = N/\mathrm{im \,} \varphi$, and the coimage is $\mathrm{coim\,} \varphi = M/\mathrm{ker\,}\varphi$. The first isomorphism tells us that for an $A$-linear map $\mathrm {coim \,} \varphi\simeq N$. 

**Remark 1.2.** 
1. $L \xrightarrow{\varphi} M$ is injective if and only $0 \to L   \xrightarrow{\varphi} M$ is exact at $L$.
2. $M \xrightarrow{\psi} N$ is surjective if and only $M   \xrightarrow{\psi} N \to 0 $ is exact at $N$.

**Lemma 1.3.** 
1. The sequence $0 \to L  \xrightarrow{\varphi}  M \xrightarrow{\psi} N \to 0$ is exact if and only if $\varphi$ is injective, $\psi$ is surjective, and $\mathrm {im \, } \varphi = \mathrm {ker \, } \psi$. Alternatively, we can replace the last condition with that there is an induced isomorphism $M / \mathrm{im\,} \varphi \xrightarrow{\sim} N$.
2. If $\varphi \in \mathrm {Hom}_A (L,M)$ is an injective map, then there is a short exact sequence $ 0 \to L \xrightarrow{\varphi} M \xrightarrow{\pi}\mathrm{coker\,} \varphi \to 0$.
3. If $\psi \in \mathrm{Hom}_A(M,N)$ is a surjective map, then there is a short exact sequence $ 0 \to \mathrm{ker \,} \psi \xrightarrow{i} M \xrightarrow{\psi} N \to 0$, where $i$ is the canonical injection.

*Proof.* (1.) The forward and backwards direction are obvious, but note that $\psi$ induces an isomorphism $M / \mathrm {im \,}\varphi \to N$ as $\psi\colon M \to N$ is an $A$-linear map then there is an isomorphism $M/\mathrm{ker\,}\psi \to N$, as $\psi$ is surjective, and thus as the sequence is exact at $M$, we have $M/\mathrm{im\,} \varphi \xrightarrow{\sim} N$. (2.) Let $\varphi \colon L \to M$ be an injective map. As $\varphi$ is injective and $\pi \colon M \to M/\mathrm {im \, } \varphi = \mathrm{coker \, } \varphi$ is surjective, and we have that the sequence is exact by (1) as $\mathrm{ker \,} \pi = \\{ x\in M \colon \pi (x) = x+\mathrm{im\,} \varphi \\} = \mathrm{im \,} \varphi$. (3) Let $\psi \colon M \to N$ be a surjective map. We have the injection $i \colon \mathrm {ker \,} \psi \to M$ by $i(x) = x$ as $\mathrm {ker \,} \varphi \psi M$, and $\psi$ is surjective so it remains to check $\mathrm {im \,} i = \mathrm{ker\,} \psi $. Now, $\mathrm {im\,} i = \\{ i(x) = x \colon x \in \mathrm {ker \,} \psi \\} = \mathrm {ker \,} \psi.$ â–¨
