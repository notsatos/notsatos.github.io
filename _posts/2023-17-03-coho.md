There is an object in mathematics that I believe, at least for someone interested in surrounding areas of algebra (but definitely in other areas as well!), that one will encounter again and again (there will never be a time without its importance): (co)homology. The study of homology theory can be motivated in many ways, e.g. (co)homology being an invariant attached to a topological spaces. That is, (co)homology are invariant under homotopy equivalence, so if two topological spaces have different (co)homology then they are not equivalent. To be clear, (co)homology assigns to any topological space $X$ a sequence of abelian groups $H_k (X)$, $ k \geq 0 $, and to any continuous map $f \colon X \to Y$ of topological spaces, a sequence of homomorphisms $f_\ast \colon H_k (X) \to H_k (Y)$, $k \geq 0$. The study of homological algebra is something that has (arguably) a lot of its strength in topology, but homological algebra in its own right has a lot to say about other algebraic structures in the field of algbera. Attached to this vein, Eisenbud's analogy is that homological algebra is to ring theory as representation theory is to group theory. A simple problem (that is really not so simple) that can be reformulated in terms of homological algebra is as follows:

> Given a variety $V(f_1, \ldots, f_n)$, we may want to ask ourselves if we can define this same variety for a small amount of polynomial equations; that is, there exists polynomials $g_1, \ldots, g_m$ where $m <n$ such that $ \sqrt{(g_1,\ldots, g_m)} = \sqrt{(f_1,\ldots, f_n)}$. This problem relates to Hilbert's Nullstellensatz, which says that the only other polynomials which vanish on $V(f_1,\ldots, f_n)$ are the ones in $ \sqrt{(f_1,\ldots, f_n)}$. Recall for an ideal $I \subset k[T_1, \ldots, T_n] =A$ we define $V(I)= \\{ x \in k^n \colon f(x) = 0, \forall f \in I \\}$, and for a subset $Y \subset k^n$ we define $I(Y) = \\{ f \in A \colon f(x)=0, \forall x \in Y \\}$.

> **Theorem (Nullstellensatz).** Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field. If $I$ is an ideal of $k[T_1, \ldots, T_n]$, then $$I(V(I))=\sqrt{I}.$$
> The question we might have about the above $V(f_1,\ldots, f_n)$ is: What if there isn't such a collection $\\{g_1, \ldots, g_m\\}$? How can we know? Well, it turns out that *local cohomology* is way to prove this: Given an noetherian ring $A$ and an ideal $I \subset A$, if $I$ can be generated by $n$ elements, then for any $A$-module $M$ and any $i >n$, we must have $H^i_I(M)=0$. Hence to prove that $I$ cannot be generated by $n$ many elements, it suffices to find an $A$-module $M$ such that $H^{n+1} _I (M) \neq 0 $.
