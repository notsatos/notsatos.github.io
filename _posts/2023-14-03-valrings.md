The use of *valuations rings*, and almost anything surrounding a *valuation* is a hot topic in algebra. For great reason though: they're incredibly useful! In particular, the theory of valuations is vast and is useful in the field of arithmetic geometry; this is our motivation. The overall treatment will, in a way, follow [Hub93]. We learn about valuations for the sake of learning more about so-called *adic spaces* and other adjacent structures. There's many ways to begin this discussion as there are in fact a couple of equivalent definitions for the things we want to look at. For example, a discrete valuation ring can be developed in terms of a particular discrete valuation on a field, say, $v \colon k \to \mathbb Z \cup  \\\{ + \infty \\\}$, whereby we define the *discrete valuation ring*, with respect to this valuation, as $\mathcal O_k := \\\{ x \in k \colon v(x) \geq 0 \\\}$. Alternatively, you can begin with instead $A$ being a Noetherian domain with fraction field $k$, with $A$ not a field. Then $A$ is a *discrete valuation ring* if $x $ or $x^{-1}$ is in $A$ for each $x \in k^\times$. In an algebraic geometry course of mine, taken just last semester in Fall $2022$, we followed the latter construction of a discrete valuation ring, so we will (in a biased way) proceed in this way.

## 1. Valuations

**Definition 1.1.** If $A$ and $B$ are local rings, we say that **$B$ dominates $A$** if $\mathfrak m_A \subset \mathfrak m_B$, i.e. $\mathfrak m_A = \mathfrak m_B \cap A$.

For a field $k$, we can consider its local subrings, and order them in terms with dominations. That is, for two local subrings $(A, \mathfrak m_A)$ and $(B, \mathfrak m_ B)$ of $k$, we write $A \leq B$ if and only if $B$ dominates $A$, i.e. $A \leq B$ if and only if $\mathfrak m_A \subset \mathfrak m_B$.

**Definition 1.2. ([Sta], <a href="https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/00I9">Tag 00I9</a>)** Let $A$ be a ring. We say $A$ is a **valuation ring**
