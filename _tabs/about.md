Currently an undergraduate student at USC (Junior/3rd year) interested in research surrounding algebraic geometry, arithmetic geometry, commutative algebra, and adjacent fields. As an example work, here's a (rough draft) preprint for a current paper being written about an analogue of Mumford's famous drawing of the spectrum of the polynomial ring of integers: <a href="https://notsatos.github.io/files/p_adic-spec-final_bnw.pdf">*ON THE PRIME SPECTRUM OF THE p-ADIC INTEGER POLYNOMIAL RING WITH A DEPICTION*</a>. Lastly, here is my <a href="https://notsatos.github.io/files/cv.pdf">CV</a>.
